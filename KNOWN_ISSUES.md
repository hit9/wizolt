## TUI resize and scrollback

**Resolved.** The history below is kept because it explains why the solution has the shape it does,
and why the cheaper-looking alternatives above it are dead ends.

### Current decision

Wizolt keeps its whole UI on the terminal's primary screen, and completed output stays in native
terminal and tmux scrollback. Two mechanisms make that survive a reflow, and both are required:

* Completed output is written into a DEC scroll region strictly above the application
  (`CSI 1;<top> r`), so printed lines scroll the transcript -- and only the transcript -- off the
  top into scrollback. The application's rows are never erased and never re-enter the terminal's
  text flow, which is what used to leave blank rows and stale fragments behind.
* A width change rewraps every row in the pane, after which nothing can identify which rows the
  application owns. Rather than guess, the terminal is purged and the transcript is re-emitted
  from memory. The transcript, not the terminal, is the source of truth.

Both run from inside the render cycle. The application's absolute position is derived state that
any resize invalidates, so deriving it from the emitting task races every resize and writes lines
onto rows that belong to something else. `wizolt/tui/scrollback.py` carries the details.

This rests on two measured tmux behaviours rather than on anything the protocol guarantees:
a scroll region anchored at row 1 feeds rows scrolled off it into native history, and a pane
keeps its cursor line at the bottom across a reflow, pulling rows back out of history when it
grows. Both were verified on tmux 3.4 and again on 3.7c; CI runs the acceptance tests against
the runner's tmux and, in the `tmux-latest` job, against a current tmux built from source. If a
future tmux changes either behaviour, that job is where it will show up.

**The accepted cost:** purging takes the user's pre-existing shell history with it, so after the
first width change `Ctrl-b [` no longer reaches what was on screen before wizolt started. This is
deliberate. The alternative -- deleting a computed number of physical rows -- destroys transcript
when the estimate drifts, which it does, and that is strictly worse. Everything wizolt itself
printed is replayed, including the startup banner and restored transcript, which is why every
printed row must reach the recorder (`tests/test_tui_transcript_recording.py`).

Exclusive viewers such as `/diff` may still use the alternate screen.

### Symptoms this used to produce

The rest of this section describes the problem as it stood before the fix, and the attempts that
failed. It is kept as the reasoning record; none of it is a live defect.

#### Dynamic activity and thinking output

During a long-running or streaming turn, repeatedly zooming and unzooming a tmux pane can leave:

- old thinking or activity frames in the visible pane;
- duplicated fragments in scrollback;
- blank rows that accumulate after each resize; and
- stale copies of the prompt or divider.

The current resize re-anchor keeps the live prompt from steadily climbing toward the top of the
pane, but it does not make the underlying primary-screen text flow reversible.

#### Inline command selectors

Selectors such as `/provider`, `/model`, and `/effort` temporarily make the non-full-screen
prompt-toolkit application taller. After the selector closes, a later tmux zoom/unzoom can expose
the former region as a large blank area in both the pane and scrollback.

A typical reproduction is:

1. Start `wizolt --yolo` inside tmux with existing shell output above it.
2. Open `/effort`, choose an item, and return to the normal prompt.
3. Zoom and unzoom the pane several times. One successful cycle is not sufficient.
4. Inspect both the visible pane and tmux copy-mode history.

The selector remains inline today because the alternatives tested below were less safe or less
usable.

### Related issue that is only partially solved

Commit `79fbfc2` added the current resize re-anchor. It fixes one specific failure: after tmux moves
the already-rendered application during reflow, the prompt no longer trusts the drifted cursor
position and climbs upward on every cycle. `tests/test_tui_resize.py` models and protects that
invariant.

That fix does not remove physical rows already inserted into the primary-screen text flow. It also
does not prove that real tmux scrollback is unchanged. Treat prompt anchoring and scrollback
preservation as separate properties.

### Why this is difficult

Wizolt deliberately combines two different models:

- completed transcript is ordinary terminal output and belongs in native scrollback; and
- drafts, live activity, selectors, and status are a repaintable prompt-toolkit application at the
  bottom of the primary screen.

tmux reflows physical terminal rows when pane width changes. A logical application row can become
several physical rows, including rows carrying historical wrap state. prompt-toolkit knows its last
logical screen, but it cannot read the terminal screen or scrollback and therefore cannot determine
which reflowed rows still belong to the live application.

The available terminal operations do not close that information gap:

- Erasing clears cells but does not remove rows from the terminal's text flow. Redrawing a shorter
  region can therefore leave permanent empty rows.
- Deleting lines can shorten the flow, but deleting one row too many destroys the transcript
  immediately above the application. The exact excess row count drifts across repeated reflows.
- A cursor-position report provides the cursor row, not row ownership or the contents and wrap
  state of the rows above it.
- Width estimates derived from the previous render become inaccurate after tmux repeatedly splits
  and rejoins wrapped history.
- Resize delivery is not a single clean event: SIGWINCH and prompt-toolkit's own size check may
  both invoke resize handling around different rendered frames.
- Streaming thinking text changes while resize and repaint are in progress, making the old and new
  regions different even without reflow.

There is consequently no safe primary-screen command that means "remove exactly the old live UI
and preserve every transcript row".

### Attempts and outcomes

#### Bottom re-anchor and erase

Commits `79fbfc2` and `80fa665` explored re-anchoring, erasing, and repainting from the pane bottom.
This can keep the visible prompt and live region single-copy in slow or static cases. Under repeated
fast resizing it still accumulates blank rows because erase does not shorten the text flow.

The broader live-region change from `80fa665` was reverted by `cb88770`. Commit `8ec86d4` preserves
the detailed handoff for that unresolved investigation.

#### CSI line deletion

Deleting reflowed rows with CSI `M` produced clean results for an isolated resize. It failed over
long sequences because the estimated number of excess physical rows drifted. Under-deletion left
fragments; over-deletion consumed real transcript lines. This is not an acceptable trade-off.

#### Alternate screen for command selectors

Commit `7ea8536` moved ordinary command selectors to the alternate screen. It appeared correct on
the first selector and resize cycle, but later cycles could restore an incomplete primary screen
and remove existing shell or transcript history from view. An additional attempt to avoid erasing
the primary buffer before the switch did not stabilize repeated resize behavior.

The change was fully reverted by `14c25ea`.

#### Fixed-height compact selector

An uncommitted experiment replaced the normal input region with a three-row selector. It avoided
height growth by construction, but the selector was too small to compare options or read useful
previews. The implementation was discarded.

#### Floating selector

A second uncommitted experiment used a roughly ten-row prompt-toolkit `Float`, whose preferred
height does not contribute to the main layout. In practice the available region was still too
narrow in important terminal states, and real tmux testing still showed primary-history loss. The
unit model's stable preferred height was not evidence that tmux's physical history was preserved.
The implementation was discarded.

#### Full-screen application

Running the entire interactive application on the alternate screen would avoid most primary-screen
reflow artifacts and is the conventional design for full-screen TUIs. It would also remove the live
conversation from native terminal scrollback and make Wizolt behave more like an editor or system
monitor. That is a product-level trade-off, not a local resize fix, and has not been accepted.

### Testing limitations

`tests/test_tui_resize.py` uses a deterministic terminal model and is valuable for cursor anchoring,
but it cannot reproduce all of tmux's behavior:

- alternate-screen buffer restoration;
- persistent wrap flags in scrollback;
- tmux's exact reflow across multiple width transitions;
- ordering between tmux resize, SIGWINCH, CPR, and prompt-toolkit redraws; and
- the interaction between continuous streamed updates and reflow.

A single successful resize, an unchanged prompt-toolkit preferred height, or a clean visible pane
is not sufficient evidence. Scrollback must also be inspected after repeated cycles.

### Acceptance criteria for any future fix

A future implementation must use a real tmux integration test in addition to unit tests. At a
minimum it must demonstrate all of the following:

1. Seed the primary screen with uniquely numbered shell-history and transcript marker lines.
2. Exercise idle input, a long command selector, streaming thinking/activity, Ask, and approval.
3. Repeat at least 30 wide/narrow and tall/short resize cycles; include zoom/unzoom.
4. Run with both slow pauses and rapid resize while streamed content changes.
5. Preserve every marker exactly once in `tmux capture-pane -p -S -` output.
6. Keep the prompt, status, and active frame single-copy in the visible pane.
7. Show no unbounded growth in blank rows or total captured rows.
8. Remain correct after opening and closing the same selector more than once.
9. Keep selectors usable at small, normal, and large pane sizes, including previews and long option
   lists.
10. Preserve Ctrl-C, Esc, Enter, search, and resize behavior without hangs.
11. Work when tmux alternate-screen support is enabled and when it is disabled.
12. Preserve native transcript scrollback after the application exits.

The test must fail against the current implementation for the specific artifact it claims to fix.
Do not replace the real-tmux test with `DummyOutput`, preferred-height assertions, or a synthetic
terminal alone.

### Relevant code and tests

- `wizolt/tui/app.py`: modal layout, primary/alternate-screen transitions, animation, and resize
  re-anchoring.
- `wizolt/tui/views.py`: choice, Ask, activity, and divider fragments.
- `wizolt/cli/modals.py`: command-selector, Ask, approval, and exclusive-viewer entry points.
- `tests/test_tui_resize.py`: the modeled prompt re-anchor contract.
- `tests/test_tui_scrollback.py`: prompt-toolkit suspension and ordered scrollback output.
- `tests/test_diff_command.py`: alternate-screen capability behavior for the exclusive diff viewer.

### How it was resolved

Three of the four foundations this section used to ask for are what the fix is built on:

- a real tmux harness that measures physical history (`tests/test_tui_tmux_scrollback.py`), used
  throughout development rather than written afterwards;
- an architecture that no longer mixes mutable live rows with append-only transcript rows -- the
  scroll region keeps the application's rows out of the text flow entirely; and
- an explicit product decision, which is the scrollback purge on a width change described above.

The fourth -- a prompt-toolkit change exposing physical-row ownership -- turned out to be
unnecessary. `Renderer.rows_above_layout` already yields the application's absolute top, and
because the application is always flush with the pane bottom and tmux pins the cursor line there
across a reflow, its origin can be handed to the renderer instead of asked for. Removing the CPR
round trip removed the window in which the application's position was unknown; measured against
the harness, keeping the CPR was almost three times worse.

Two earlier ideas were measured and rejected, both worse than the shipped approach: restoring the
cursor with DECSC/DECRC instead of an absolute row, and re-anchoring from a cursor position report.

If this regresses, the acceptance criteria below still apply. Preserving transcript data still
takes priority over hiding resize artifacts.
