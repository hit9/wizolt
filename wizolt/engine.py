    """Run one user turn to a final answer, composing context, model, and tools.

    A turn is a transaction: messages accumulate in a local list, checkpoint into the session's
    active-turn buffer, and reach durable history only on commit, on settle after an interrupt, or
    on an error flush. Nothing else may append to that history mid-turn.

    The loop alternates model requests and tool batches until the model answers without calling a
    tool, `max_steps` runs out, or the user cancels. A turn is one task, so cancelling it reaches
    every layer it is awaiting; the turn settles what it has and re-raises.

    Queued input is claimed per request and acknowledged only once that request succeeds, so a retry
    never swallows a follow-up.
