"""Compaction: turn one conversation span into a summary checkpoint.

The policy here decides what to compact (split/keep), how to ask for the summary (the inline
slice that reuses the turn's cached prefix, or the flattened payload), and how to run the
request with its format-retry and echo guard.

A `Compactor` binds the two collaborators the policy spans: the ContextManager (projection,
token budget, write-back) and the ModelClient (the request machinery). Planning methods
(`parts`, `split`, `request`, `input`) need only the context; `compact`/`compact_attempts`
need the model; `run` drives both.

        (see ContextManager._summary_block and DESIGN.md, "Compaction reads the cache; the rebuild
        does not").

        A cache hit needs a byte-identical prefix, so this slices `model_messages` -- the very list
        the turn just sent -- rather than assembling a lookalike from `compacted`. They are not the
        same thing: `compacted` has had `without_compaction_summaries` applied and has not had the
        describe/skill dedup applied, so a request built from it diverges at the first earlier
        summary and at every repeated schema, which cost the whole conversation and left only the
        header cached.

        The slice therefore ends one message later than `compacted` does, taking in the latest user
        message that `compacted` deliberately excludes. That message is kept either way -- what is
        evicted is decided by `keep`, not by this request -- so the only effect is that the
        compactor sees what is being worked on right now, which helps it.

        Eligible only when the summary runs on the entry that served the turn: a `[compaction]`
        entry elsewhere is a different cache namespace, so rebuilding the prefix would cost the
        whole history at full rate to save nothing.

        One case builds the slice and gets no cache for it: a turn-scope pass that follows a
        history-scope pass in the same projection, where session.messages has just been rewritten
        and no request with that prefix has ever been sent. It is not a regression -- the flattened
        payload never hit either, and the real messages are still worth more to the summarizer than
