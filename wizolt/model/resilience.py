# 429 carries two opposite meanings and cannot be retried uniformly: transient rate limiting
# (retry after backoff is right) and permanent quota/billing failures (retrying just makes the
# user wait through the backoff for an error that will never clear). Compatible endpoints express
# the permanent class as 429 plus account/billing wording in the error body. The marker set below
# deliberately captures shared meanings rather than branching on a provider name or error code.
# This is a fail-open heuristic: unknown wording retries as before, preferring to miss a
# permanent error over misclassifying a transient rate limit as a billing failure.
#
# The markers are phrases, not words, because the vocabulary overlaps: a transient limit is
# commonly phrased with the same nouns the permanent class uses. "Quota exceeded for quota
# metric ... per minute" and similarly named rate-quota errors are per-minute
# limits that clear on their own, so a bare "quota" marker would fail them at once — the exact
# outcome this rule exists to prevent. Same for bare "expired" and "credit", which appear in
# transient infrastructure errors that have nothing to do with an account.
