    Confirmation is the default, and the read-only allowlist is the narrow exception — it exists
    because this tool replaced the dedicated listing and search tools, and prompting for every `ls`
    would be unusable. Auto-approval must hold for the whole command, not its first word: every stage
    of a pipeline or `&&` chain must independently be read-only, redirection to a real path or command
    substitution disqualifies it, and wrappers that can hide execution are never approved. This is a
    prompting heuristic, not a sandbox; confirmation remains the real boundary.

    The process gets its own session, so cancelling kills the whole group instead of orphaning
    children of an already-exited shell. Output is decoded incrementally per stream, so a multibyte
    character split across reads survives. If it remains active past the foreground wait timeout,
    the same process is registered as a background job and its bounded output tail remains available
    through `Job`.
