    """Resolve a batch of Edit calls against an in-memory file model before anything is written.

    Every line in the planned model carries the source view and line it came from, so a later
    call in the same batch can use a pre-edit view after earlier insertions shifted its untouched
    lines. A later call targeting a line consumed by an earlier edit is refused; calls using
    different views of one path validate against the planned current state in model order.
    This is also what lets confirmation show the final result rather than the first step of it.

    Planning touches no file. Each planned edit records the content it expects and re-checks it
    at write time, so an edit computed against a file that changed underneath is rejected instead
    of clobbering it. A call that cannot be planned records its error against the call id rather
    than raising, keeping the one-result-per-call contract.
