    `label` names it in the viewer title and the action row ("order", "script"). `lexer` is a
    pygments lexer name; empty means the text is prose and renders as markdown. `rows` are the
    header fields shown above the text. `result` is what the call returned, shown below the text
    when the view is opened after the fact; it is empty at a confirmation prompt, where the call
    has not run yet.
