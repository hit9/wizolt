"""Net diffs: what a turn or a session changed, reconstructed from recorded edits.

A pure algorithm over `TurnDiff` records and the files on disk -- unified-diff generation,
forward/reverse hunk application, legacy reconstruction, and rename detection. It reads `cwd` as
an argument and nothing else from the session, which is why it lives beside `Session` rather than
on it: the session owns the records, this owns what they mean.

`Session.latest_round_diff_sections` and `Session.session_diff_sections` are the two entry points
the UI uses; everything else here is how they are computed.
