"""Pure source-view values, rendering, range validation, and exact relocation.

A source view is an immutable, session-scoped record of source lines actually projected to the
model. Tools build drafts; the runner commits them on the main thread. This package owns the pure
parts only: it imports no runner, tool, context, or Session code, so source-producing tools stay
parallel-safe and no feature module becomes a second writer of active turn state.

Behavior lives on the values it belongs to -- `view.range_lines(...)`, `block.render(key)`,
`output.project(...)` -- so the surface here is four types plus the exact-matching functions,
which take current file lines rather than a view and therefore have no receiver to live on.
