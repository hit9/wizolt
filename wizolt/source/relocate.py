"""Exact matching of a view's target against the lines a file currently has.

These are the only functions here that look at current file content rather than at a view, which
is why they are functions over `list[str]` and not methods on anything: the file is not a value
this package owns. Matching is exact and bounded by construction -- never similarity, syntax,
embeddings, or partial hashes -- because a plausible target is not proof, and the cost of being
wrong is a silently corrupted file.
