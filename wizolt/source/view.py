"""Source views: the immutable record of the lines a tool actually showed the model.

A view is evidence, not authority. Everything here is behavior of that evidence -- what it
contains, which line ranges it can vouch for, and what it says when asked for a range it never
projected -- so it lives on the values themselves rather than beside them. Nothing in this module
imports a runner, tool, context, or Session: views are built on worker threads and committed on
the main one, so they must be safe to construct anywhere.
