"""Structured tool output: source blocks, their model-facing text, and budget projection.

A tool's result cannot be a plain string any more: it has to carry both the full text kept under
`tr.N` and the exact source blocks that survived output bounding, because only the surviving lines
may become a view. ToolOutput is that pair, and rendering and projection are things it does to
itself -- the runner supplies the assigned keys and the budget, and nothing else needs to know how
a block is laid out.
