    """Project session state into one request's messages and compact it to fit the budget.

    Request projection is derived at the send boundary and never stored: replay transforms must not
    write back into history. Compaction is the deliberate persisted exception. When the projected
    request exceeds its budget, older messages are captured in retained history and replaced by one
    summary checkpoint. Layer order exists for prompt-cache stability — version-stable system and
    tools, then session-stable environment/capability context, then the append-only conversation and
    active turn. Mutable working state is written as tool history or compaction checkpoints; inserting
    a rebuilt block into the conversation prefix would invalidate later cache reuse.

    Request-local transforms belong here rather than in stored messages: repeated MCP schemas and
    skill loads collapse to a pointer at the first copy, re-promoted when compaction removes it.

    The budget is the context limit less the provider's output reserve and a safety margin, measured
    against the payload that actually crosses the wire. Over budget compacts prior history first, and
    the current turn only if still over.
