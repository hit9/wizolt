# Design notes

This file records decisions whose rationale is easy to lose and costly to rediscover. Keep it
short: document durable conclusions, not implementation diaries or complete investigation logs.

## Orientation

wizolt turns one user request into a bounded loop of model and tool calls in one local process.
Four objectives, often in tension, explain most decisions below:

1. **Resumable.** A session survives a crash, an interrupt, or a quit at any point.
2. **Protocol-neutral.** History is stored in one model; Chat, Responses, and Anthropic formats
   exist only at the send boundary.
3. **Bounded.** Context, retained output, and previews all have ceilings; nothing grows forever.
4. **Truthful.** The screen reports real state; completed output lives in native scrollback,
   with the resize/replay trade-off documented under Terminal boundary.

Modules (dependencies point downward only):

```
              __main__                     entry, startup ordering
                  |

        |                                    TUI runtime (cli/runtime.py), view (cli/view.py),

                  |
            providers/catalog.py           evidence-backed compatibility data
```

Three import rings stay runtime-only so the module graph above stays a DAG. Every upward edge is a
deferred import commented at its call site; lifting one to module scope makes the cycle part of
startup.

- **Orchestration ring (`tools/` ↔ engine).** `Delegate` spawns a worker by constructing
  `engine.Agent` (`tools/delegate.py`). The downward direction — engine/runner/model importing
  `tools` — is module scope. `ToolScript` needs no edge of its own: it uses the `ToolRunner` it was
  handed (`TYPE_CHECKING` only) and gets edit planning from `tools/editplan.py`. Separately, inside
  `tools/` a submodule that needs `TOOL_REGISTRY` or `tool_payload` imports it locally, because the
  registry in `__init__.py` is built on top of every tool module.
- **Session features (`session/` ↔ mcp/skill/mentions).** `Session` itself is feature-free:
  `__post_init__` never reaches upward. `bootstrap_features()` (deferred imports inside) attaches
  `MCPManager`/`SkillLibrary`/`FileMentions` when needed, called by `Session.from_config_file` and
  `Session.load_snapshot`; the delegate worker handoff injects the parent's `skills`/`mcp` fields
  explicitly instead, and `session/store.py` still imports its parent package at load time.
- **Assets (`image.py` ↔ session/).** `session/` imports the image value types at module scope;
  `ImageInputs.assets_dir` reaches back for `SessionSnapshotStore.session_path`, the one place the
  asset directory's layout is owned (`image.py`).

A turn, and its three endings:

```
  user input
      |
      v
  +-- Agent.run -------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                              |
  |   claim queued input                                         |
  |         |                                                    |
  |         v                                                    |
  |   context.prepare_messages --> model.request                 |
  |         ^                            |                       |
  |         |                     tool calls?  -- no --> answer  |
  |         |                            | yes                   |
  |         |                            v                       |
  |         +--------------------- runner.run(batch)             |
  |                                                              |
  |   checkpoint: turn start, each tool batch, each follow-up    |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                    |                      |
   commit               interrupt               error
      v                    v                      v
  append to           retract, or keep       flush partial turn,
  session.messages    partial + marker       re-raise
```

The turn is a transaction: messages accumulate outside durable history until one of those three
endings, and nothing else may append mid-turn.

## Common pitfalls

Each looks like a cleanup and breaks something the code depends on; the section naming the rule
is in parentheses.

- **Refreshing recent activity inside an existing checkpoint.** The activity receipt is frozen
  alongside working state during compaction; normal requests never receive a changing activity
  prefix. `Note(view)` may append a newer view. File/error observations reuse persisted receipts;
  ten bounded foreground command receipts survive pruning of larger tool results. Record actual
  exit codes at result settlement -- a timeout settles at the -1 its result reported, not the
  kill signal -- and never infer test success or Git commits from output. Cancelled, refused and
  background-promoted commands have no completed foreground receipt. The projection keeps up to
  ten distinct paths, ten command/outcome pairs and five tool errors, oldest to newest within each
  group, with a 6,000-character body ceiling. It is historical evidence, not a complete
  side-effect journal or current task status. No new retention roots are introduced:
  dots in id-shaped activity text are JSON-escaped before freezing,
  because checkpoints and Note results are scanned for ids when views and results are pruned.
  Quoted paths and commands still decode to their original values; never replace digits in a
  real filename with a placeholder. Historical ids in activity may already have expired.
  Explicit Bash working directories are frozen at execution and retained with command receipts
  and promoted jobs. Equal commands in different directories are different observations.
  This borrows Codex's committed-change evidence principle, not its model-driven cross-session
  memory pipeline.

- **Lifting a deferred import to module scope.** Startup latency is a feature; the SDKs cost ~0.8s
  and are not needed until the first request (Startup path).
- **Rewriting stored history in a request transform.** Replay rules, image expansion, and schema
  dedup are send-time only; a resumed session must equal the saved one (Context is a projection).
- **Returning fewer tool results than the model emitted calls.** Refused, failed, skipped, and
  interrupted calls each need a matching result, or replay is invalid (Tool-call lifecycle).
- **Inserting context between the stable layers.** Saving tokens mid-prompt invalidates the cached
  prefix for every later turn (Context is a projection).
- **Persisting a live preview row, or reading state back off the screen.** Rendered text is never
  the source of truth (Three forms of state, Terminal boundary).
- **Expecting compaction to rescue an oversized fixed prefix.** It cannot; bound the source at its
  owner or fail clearly (Compaction).
- **Retrying a failure that is not transient.** Cancellation, capability rejection, and validation
  errors are decisions, not glitches (Failure boundaries).
- **Replacing the scroll region/replay with erase-and-print, estimated row deletion, or resize
  CPR.** Those approaches already failed repeated real-tmux reflow (Terminal boundary).
- **Mocking the behavior under test instead of the external boundary** (Test design).

## Maintenance

- Docstrings describe interfaces and contracts, not development history.
- Comments protect local, non-obvious invariants and may link to primary evidence.
- Add a note here only for a cross-cutting decision maintainers may otherwise reopen; keep old
  conclusions visible and mark them superseded when a decision changes.

### Engineering posture

- **Abstract:** deep, local, earned abstractions behind small interfaces; remove dead code and
  pass-through wrappers.
- **Layer:** dependencies point from orchestration toward stable lower-level concepts; lower
  modules never import presentation or orchestration.
- **Keep it simple:** smallest cohesive, behavior-preserving change; no speculative specialization;
  keep the changelog aligned.
- Prefer generic standards; specialize only for a necessary, documented incompatibility, with
  primary evidence beside the rule.
- Prefer explicit imports and pragmatic typing; suppress a type error only when runtime behavior is
  demonstrably safe.
- Test contracts and reproduced regressions at their boundaries; CI enforces formatting, lint,
  typing, and the full suite.
- Keep UI and user docs quiet and direct; keep compatibility machinery and investigation history
  out of the common user path.

### Test design

Tests protect observable contracts and reproduced regressions, not implementation shape.

- Prefer black-box tests at the narrowest stable public boundary observing complete behavior;
  white-box only when a pure algorithm or edge cannot be exercised clearly there.
- A bug fix reproduces the real failure, then covers the intended result and unsafe paths that must
  stay rejected.
- Assert semantic output, durable state, or protocol payloads; exact text, call order, or rendering
  only when those details are the contract.
- Mock external or nondeterministic boundaries (providers, clocks, processes, terminals); never the
  core behavior under test.
- Keep tests deterministic and fast; reserve PTY/tmux for behavior that truly needs a terminal.

## System shape

- `base.py` defines configuration, shared value types, and error categories, plus the log-line
  vocabulary and resource handles; `providers/compat.py` folds `providers/catalog.py` data into resolved
  request policy.
- `Session` owns protocol-neutral semantic state (messages, transcript, checkpoints, queued input,
  retained output, diffs, usage, session resources); its snapshot codec decides what is persistable.
- Agent semantics split by owner: `context.py` projects/compacts, `model/` owns adapters,
  streaming, retry, `runner.py` owns execution/cancellation, `engine.py` composes the turn loop.
  Dependencies point downward only, so no pair needs a deferred import.
- `CommandLoop`/`TuiRuntime` orchestrate commands and transitions; `TuiApp` owns input, keys,
  layout, modals; `render.py` owns presentation.
- `tools/`, `image.py`, `mcp/`, `skill.py` are vertical features that never leak storage or UI
  details; `tools/` splits built-ins by capability, with the registry in `__init__.py`.
- How a call *reads* is a tool concern, not a runner one: `tools/tooloutput.py` bounds and parses
  result text, `tools/toolblocks.py` assembles the approval/rejection/finish `LogBlock` trees. Both
  are pure over the call, the tool, and the session — `render.py` still owns turning a block into
  styled terminal output, so this is the log-line vocabulary from `base.py`, not UI leaking down.
  Keeping them out of `ToolRunner` is what lets transcript replay render a saved call without
  standing up a live runner.
- Inside `toolblocks`, `finish_display`/`approval_display` branch on `call.name` for the handful of
  tools with a shaped result (Note, Bash, MCP, ToolScript, Ask, Delegate, ViewImage). That switch
  stays deliberately: a rendering hook on the `Tool` base would put six special cases into the
  interface every tool implements, and one chain that reads top to bottom is easier to keep
  consistent than seven overrides. Push the branches down onto the tool classes when a tool outside
  the built-in set needs its own finish block, not merely because the chain is long.

State changes belong to the module owning their meaning. Dependencies point toward stable
concepts: configuration and value types do not know the runtime; feature and session modules do not
know the command loop or terminal. Do not add a shared module to break a cycle — fix the ownership
instead.

### Startup path

Nothing a first keystroke does not need may be imported at startup. Interactive startup was once
939ms — 934ms imports, 5ms work. The heavy SDKs import at their point of use: `MCPManager` defers
`fastmcp` (~0.35s), `ModelClient` defers `anthropic`/`openai` (~0.8s together), names declared
under `TYPE_CHECKING`. Do not lift them back to module scope; `tests/test_cli.py` asserts a fresh
interpreter loads neither SDK.

`main` warms the deferred SDKs on a daemon thread so deferral does not move the cost to the first
request; racing is safe because CPython locks imports per module (see `warm_provider_sdks`).

The entry point writes the interactive banner before importing the session and rendering stacks,
then tells the first `CommandLoop` not to repeat it. Keep that one static line outside the runtime's
ordered scrollback path: a terminal that does not answer prompt-toolkit's initial cursor-position
probe can hold that path for about a second. Embeddings, non-TTY runs, resumed sessions, restored
history, and all later output retain the ordinary command-loop and ordered-scrollback paths.

### Future MCP client lifecycle

`MCPManager` opens a short-lived client per discovery/tool/resource operation: fine for stateless
servers, but it restarts stdio processes and cannot preserve legacy process-lifetime servers. A
future revision should use one managed client runtime per server with explicit
connect/reconnect/cancellation/close ownership. MCP is moving toward a sessionless protocol
([SEP-2567](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/2567-sessionless-mcp)); keep the current FastMCP 3
dependency until that support is stable, and do not add roots, sampling, extension, or
provider-specific machinery without a demonstrated use case.

## One loop owns the session

`CommandLoop.run()` calls `asyncio.run()` once, selects the interactive or non-TTY frontend inside
that loop, and owns everything the session does: the prompt-toolkit application, the active turn,
the model requests, MCP, compaction, vision, the ordered scrollback writer, and every background
task the runtime starts. A model request, a tool batch, an MCP call, and a keystroke are tasks that
take turns, which is what lets the prompt keep drawing while a request is in flight and lets one
cancellation reach all of it.

- No private or nested loop, no generic sync-to-async bridge, and no lower-level synchronous
  facades. `CommandLoop.run()` is the sole production runtime boundary; code that already owns a
  loop awaits `Agent.run()`, `ToolRunner.run()`, `ModelClient.request()`, `TuiRuntime.run()`, or
  `TuiApp.run()` directly. The standalone `wizolt update` command deliberately uses a synchronous
  HTTP client before any session runtime exists; the in-session update check uses the async client.
- Loop-bound primitives (queues, locks, events, futures) belong to one invocation or to the runtime.
  A long-lived object must not hold one across separate synchronous entry points: the lock created
  on a loop that has closed is not a lock.
- Threads remain only at genuinely synchronous boundaries — potentially material local file work,
  a ToolScript body, and the bounded termination of a persistent background `Popen` handle —
  reached through the managed executor or `base.run_blocking`. Search, mention discovery, fzf, the
  external editor, and `Job` waits are native async operations; foreground Bash pipes are
  event-loop readers. Edit prepares immutable snapshots, plans potentially material file changes,
  and performs its checked batch transaction through `run_blocking`, then installs receipts on the
  loop. A promoted Bash process moves both pipes to one daemon drainer because it can outlive the
  loop that launched it. A thread never gets
  an exception injected into it and never owns an async client.
- An injected synchronous input callback is an embedding boundary Python cannot cancel. It runs on
  a daemon adapter rather than the default executor, so cancelling its awaiter cannot make
  `asyncio.run()` wait forever; the embedding remains responsible for eventually unblocking it.
- `base.run_blocking(invoke)` is the one blocking bridge for state-mutating maintenance work, and
  it is not `asyncio.to_thread`: cancelling it remembers the cancellation, keeps waiting for the
  worker, observes its outcome, and only then reports cancellation upward. `asyncio.to_thread`
  returns the moment the awaiter is cancelled and leaves the worker holding whatever it holds,
  which is how a sweep ends up mutating a session after shutdown said it was done.

**Session-scoped background work has one owner.** `CommandLoop.open_background()` /
`spawn_background()` / `close_background()` admit, retain, and settle everything a session starts
outside the turn: the update check, the catalog refresh, the retention sweep, mention discovery and
completion, and post-turn code-index freshness. Both frontends open it after entering their loop
and close it before returning, in the shutdown order above (after the turn, before model/MCP). It
rejects work once closed and closes the refused coroutine, so nothing can call back into a session
that is gone. Coalescing state for shared work — the single mention scan — lives here rather than
on `Session`, because a task is loop-bound and the session outlives loops.

Six explicit thread construction sites remain, each for a reason the loop cannot serve:

1. `warm_provider_sdks` — pre-runtime import latency, started before any loop exists.
2. ToolScript's single-worker executor — arbitrary synchronous Python, kept off the loop.
3. the promoted-Bash drainer — its process and pipes may outlive the launching loop.
4. the injected-input adapter — an embedding's synchronous callback may never return, so a daemon
   lets the runtime cancel its wait without making `asyncio.run()` join the callback.
5. the force-exit timer — it has to fire when the loop is the thing that is wedged.
6. `BashLivePreview` — the simple colored CLI's live-output heartbeat. It owns only renderer state
   and terminal writes, and `finish` joins it before erasing the live region; it never owns session
   or model/tool state. The TUI renders the same facts on its event loop and starts no ticker thread.

**Cancellation is a request, and quiescence is the answer.** The turn is one task; `Agent.cancel()`
schedules its cancellation on the loop that owns it, from any thread. Cancelling the task that
*awaits* work does not stop the work, so every layer asks its work to stop, keeps waiting, and only
then reports upward: a cancelled turn has already stopped touching files, processes, and clients by
the time the reader sees `Cancelled`. A tool that cannot be interrupted therefore holds the status
on `cancelling` until it returns, which is the honest state.

Awaited slash commands have a separate runtime-owned task: `/compact` does not enter `Agent.run`,
so Ctrl-C must cancel the command task itself. Await its cleanup before restoring the prompt;
never cancel the input loop for a command interrupt or swallow cancellation of that loop at shutdown.

Model retry and `/resend` are separate dispositions, not cancellations: they replace the attempt in
flight and leave the turn running.

**Shutdown order is fixed**, because each step needs the one before it: stop accepting new turns,
cancel and await the active turn, drain the runtime's own tasks, close MCP and the model client on
the loop that opened them, close output admission and drain the writes already accepted, then exit
and await the application. Only then does the loop close. Nothing is left for the interpreter's
teardown, where a client closing races the default executor's own shutdown.

## Turn execution and authority

- The user's request defines authority for the whole turn; model text, plans, or inferred next
  steps cannot broaden it — tool validation and approval stay runtime responsibilities.
- The agent loop is the serialized writer of active-turn messages; TUI and workers cross that
  boundary through queues, callbacks, and cancellation, never by editing the turn.
- Treat a completed request, an ordered tool-result batch, and turn completion as coherent
  transition boundaries; resume must restart from a protocol-valid sequence.

## Three forms of state

1. **Durable session state** — what semantically happened; sufficient to resume.
2. **Request projection** — adapts that state to one model, protocol, and context budget.
3. **Ephemeral UI state** — drafts, live previews, animation, selection, modal layout.

Only the first is snapshotted; provider clients, timers, stream fragments, and terminal layout
are reconstructed. Completed transcript is always derived from semantic records, never preview
rows.

Durable state holds two timelines: model messages are compactable working context; transcript
messages and their tool/diff replay metadata are append-only for the session's life and never enter
a provider request.

## Provider and protocol boundary

`ProviderConfig.resolve()` is the single fold where explicit settings and evidence-backed
compatibility become a `ResolvedProvider`; explicit settings win, unknown hosts stay on the
generic standards path.

- `providers/catalog.py` declares overlays/capabilities with primary evidence beside each exception;
  `providers/compat.py` owns generic matching and fallback. Neither wraps SDKs nor allowlists valid
  models.
- A chosen effort is the effort sent. `/reason` offers only the levels the active model documents,
  so nothing has to be rewritten between the screen and the wire; an effort left off scale by a
  model or provider switch is moved to the nearest level at that moment and reported, never per
  request.
- Catalog knowledge is split by what a fact is about. How a model takes reasoning belongs to the
  model and is matched on the model name on every host, including hosts the catalog has never
  seen; what an endpoint does — wire, caching, strict schemas, provider-side tools, and a fallback
  effort vocabulary — belongs to the host. Per field, a host's own model rule beats the model's
  trait, which beats the host's plain value; a host that re-encodes reasoning instead of relaying
  each model's native spelling declares `normalizes_reasoning` and takes no traits.
- `ModelClient` owns the Chat, Responses, and Anthropic wire formats; history stays one normalized
  model with namespaced opaque fields for continuation data.
- Lifecycle/checkpoint metadata is local bookkeeping, not a provider extension: adapters strip the
  key while preserving canonical role/content — Chat sends ordinary messages; Responses maps calls
  and results to `function_call`/`function_call_output` items.
- Reasoning is continuation data: preserve what the provider returns, choose replay policy at
  projection, and estimate the same wire payload on every protocol. `reasoning_history = auto`
  selects the catalog rule; an explicit replay mode overrides it. Request-body extensions never
  implicitly change history semantics. Opaque continuation data is replayed only to the same
  endpoint, model, credential, and configured-header identity that issued it.
- Image routing is main-first with a bounded vision fallback. An unknown route sends raw image
  blocks to the active model; static evidence (a catalog of documented text-only families) or a
  session-learned HTTP-400 rule switches the route to text-only, where `[vision]` observes current
  occurrences once and the request retries without raw blocks. Learned evidence is session-local
  and never serialized; a 400 with no current image occurrence never learns.

## Context is a projection

Session messages are the protocol-neutral source of truth. A model request is derived at the send
boundary from system prompt, environment, capability indexes, append-only conversation, active
turn, and tool schemas.

- The normal layout is:

  ```
  stable tools + system
  session-stable Environment (including local session_started_at with numeric offset)
  optional skill and MCP capability indexes
  append-only conversation
  active turn
  ```

  No rebuilt Memory, history-index, current-date, recent-error, or code-index-status block is
  inserted before the tail: those values already exist in matched tool history, are queried on
  demand, or are runtime/UI state.
- Treat cache-prefix stability as the first review criterion for system prompt, tool schema or
  ordering, and context-layout changes: order from version-stable system and tools, through
  session-stable capability context, to the append-only conversation. Mutable goal/plan/known/checks
  enter that log through `Note` calls and compaction checkpoints, never as an inserted block.
  Prefix stability never justifies stale state.
- Replay rules, image expansion, request-local reminders, and repeated-schema reduction apply only
  while building the request; they never rewrite stored history or user text.
- Estimate the actual wire payload (tool schemas, image cost) and reserve output capacity plus a
  safety margin before declaring input space.
- Keep estimated request size separate from provider-reported usage: the estimate drives
  preparation/compaction; reported tokens describe past calls (observability only).
- Prompt-cache usage is an observed transport optimization, not free context: cached tokens remain
  part of the request and compaction pressure; missing write accounting does not mean no breakpoint.

### Cache epochs and breakpoints

Implicit prompt caching is exact-prefix reuse, including tool schemas; a normal turn only appends,
and `Note` updates and resume events are conversation, not context inserted ahead of it.

- A stable cache key scopes related requests but does not replace exact-prefix matching or require
  an explicit cache API.
- Changing the model, tools, system prompt, skills, MCP capabilities, or another early layer may
  shorten reuse or begin a new scope.
- Compaction replaces an old prefix and begins one new cache epoch; its checkpoint is stable
  history, so the next turn warms from it — compaction must not break every later turn.
  See "Compaction reads the cache; the rebuild does not" below before changing what a checkpoint
  carries.
- Anthropic's system breakpoint is a `ModelClient` protocol policy, not a change to the
  protocol-neutral history model.
- The tool block is part of the prefix: a per-session constant, never a per-request lever.
  Reshaping it discards the cached prefix and reads to the model as a broken tool set; steer with a
  message, never with the schema.

#### Three mechanisms, one rule

Providers differ in *where a prefix may be saved*, never in *what matches*. Every mechanism below
still requires the entire rendered prefix to be byte-identical, so the layout rule above is the
only one the context design has to obey.

1. **Implicit breakpoints** (OpenAI-shaped wires). The service picks where to write. Older
   families place them at model-dependent intervals, so coverage of a long conversation is
   partial. GPT-5.6 and later place one breakpoint at the end of the latest eligible user or tool
   message — which in an agent loop is exactly the tail of the previous step, so the whole
   conversation body is covered without wizolt asking for anything.
2. **Explicit breakpoints.** Anthropic caches only at a marked block, which is why
   `mark_prompt_cache_tail` exists: the system breakpoint alone would leave the conversation body
   uncached. GPT-5.6 also accepts explicit markers
   (`prompt_cache_options.mode: "explicit"` plus `prompt_cache_breakpoint` on a content block),
   and wizolt deliberately does not use them — the implicit breakpoint already lands where the
   explicit one would, so marking would add a wire-only field for no reuse.
3. **Server-side conversation state.** The Responses wire can retain the conversation and let a
   later request reference it by id. wizolt sends `store: false` and replays the full history
   every time. This is not a caching trade-off, it is the projection rule: session messages are
   the source of truth, a sent message is irrevocable, and a resumed session must reconstruct
   from the snapshot alone. Server-held state moves the truth off the machine that owns it.

#### Compaction reads the cache; the rebuild does not

Compaction touches the cache twice, in opposite directions. Confusing the two is how a change
that looks free turns out to cost the whole conversation.

- **The summary request reads it.** `Compactor.request` slices the very projection the turn just
  sent and appends one instruction, so the conversation is a warm prefix and only the tail is
  paid for. This is why the slice comes from `model_messages` and not from a lookalike rebuilt
  out of `compacted`: the lookalike diverges at the first earlier summary and costs the full
  history. Eligible only when the summary runs on the entry that served the turn.
- **The rebuild writes a prefix nobody has sent.** `apply_compaction` replaces the head of the
  conversation with a fresh checkpoint, so the first request after it is a guaranteed miss for
  everything past the header, and one new cache epoch begins.

Two rules the checkpoint therefore obeys:

- **Write once, at the moment already paying full price.** Everything the session still needs
  after eviction goes into the checkpoint at rebuild time. Adding to it is close to free: that
  write is a miss either way, and every later turn reads the result back warm.
- **Nothing in it may be mutable.** A checkpoint that has to be corrected later rewrites the head
  of the conversation and starts another epoch — the entire body at full price to edit one line.
  State that changes belongs in `Note` calls, which append. A snapshot that can go stale must say
  so in the text rather than be rewritten.

Corollary: compaction is worth doing rarely and thoroughly rather than often and slightly. Each
pass costs one full re-read of everything that survives it, so a wider recent window that
compacts less often beats a narrow one that fires every few turns.

GPT-5.6 specifics worth knowing when reading usage numbers
([prompt caching guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-caching)):

- The cacheable minimum is 1,024 visible input tokens, a strict floor (older families: 2,048, and
  some may cache shorter). Short sessions simply do not cache; that is not a bug to chase.
- Retention is 30 minutes from the last write or reuse, and `prompt_cache_options.ttl` accepts no
  other value. Older families default to 24h (`prompt_cache_retention`), or `in_memory` under Zero
  Data Retention. A session left idle over lunch comes back cold on GPT-5.6 and warm on GPT-5.5 —
  worth remembering before reading a cache-miss as a layout regression.
- `prompt_cache_key` influences which machine serves a request; it does not pin routing or
  guarantee a read hit. It scopes, it never substitutes for an identical prefix.
- Usage reports `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens` and `.cache_write_tokens`; `ModelUsage.add`
  already reads both spellings, so no per-family accounting branch is needed.

### A sent message is irrevocable

Every message that reaches the provider is committed to history in order; there is no
request-local message. A message the model answered but can no longer see is ghost context the
transcript, snapshot, and user cannot account for.

- Runtime nudges (live follow-up markers, protocol corrections, resume events) are ordinary
  conversation: append, checkpoint, let them age out. A marker for the model is committed with the
  message it marked; hide it at render time.
- Corrections stack rather than replace; swapping the previous correction out rewrites an
  already-sent prefix and breaks the cache.
- An aborted turn keeps what it already sent; failure settles history, it does not rewind it.
- The runtime instructs, it does not enforce: an ignored instruction is restated in the next
  message, never enforced by reshaping the request.

## Tool-call lifecycle

A tool call is intent, not a result. Consume a stream to its protocol terminal event before
dispatching its complete call set; return results before the model may judge or retry them.

- Text resembling tool markup never has execution authority. A response with no native calls but a
  complete `<invoke>` for a known tool may be discarded and retried up to five times, each
  correction a committed message with the unchanged tool list; never parse arguments or synthesize
  call ids/results.
- Every emitted call receives a matching result — malformed, refused, failed, skipped, interrupted —
  keeping replay valid across protocols.
- Independent read-only calls may run concurrently; mutating or interactive calls stay ordered, and
  all outcomes return in the model's original order.
- A tool may produce a model observation in addition to its matched textual result; observations use
  the durable protocol-neutral message model and project into provider-native multimodal shape only
  at the request boundary.
- Interrupting before assistant activity retracts the turn; once text or a call is visible, preserve
  the partial turn and add cancellation results for unanswered calls.

## Retention and recall

- A large tool result enters conversation as a bounded view; its retained full output is addressed
  by `tr.N`. `Recall` retrieves selected line ranges; a hard session ceiling prevents growth, and
  compaction prunes records nothing surviving references.
- Compaction stores one bounded verbatim excerpt of each evicted span as `seg.N`; `RecallContext`
  gets a segment or regex-searches retained segments — it never pretends the excerpt is lossless.
- Segment titles are not standing context: `RecallContext(list)` pages newest first; search covers
  the warm store; `get` retrieves excerpts.
- `AgentState` is the durable semantic view of goal/plan/known/checks; `Note(update)` changes it
  transactionally with a visible call/result in append-only history, `Note(view)` reads only.
  Compaction materializes the full state into one checkpoint before older Note history leaves
  active context.
- Recall tools create no new retained-result keys; their output is ordinary bounded context,
  requested selectively rather than copying cold detail into hot context.
- Snapshot JSONL is the persistence/resume boundary, not a search engine; runtime recall uses
  current retained indexes, never opportunistic log scans.

## Persistence and input transactions

Snapshots are project-scoped JSONL: one full snapshot plus deltas, large repeated text stored once
as content-addressed blobs. Persist semantic checkpoints, not object graphs.

- Checkpoint active turns at stable request/tool boundaries; never serialize a partial protocol
  object visible in a live preview.
- Claim queued follow-ups for the next request, acknowledge only after it succeeds, release on
  failure/interruption — retries see exactly the same input.
- Keep image assets while any persisted, queued, or retained reference needs them; collect only
  after the surviving snapshot no longer does.
- Keep model context and CLI transcript as logical streams in one JSONL: committed transcript only
  appends, and the bounded active-turn transcript is folded in exactly once after crash or
  completion.
- Persist only the provider-neutral visible projection: user/assistant text, canonical tool calls,
  semantic results keyed by `tool_call_id`. No provider continuation state or retained output
  duplication; cap replay-only arguments and Edit previews; never persist preview rows.
- Older snapshots without transcript records migrate surviving model history; content compacted by
  them is unrecoverable. Every transcript-aware write carries a sync marker, so an older writer is
  detected and resume warns of a possible transcript gap.
- Store session start once as a local ISO timestamp with numeric offset. Resume appends a
  timestamped lifecycle event with canonical role `user` — a tail addition, same through Chat and
  Responses, hidden from rendering but not from persistence or history.
- `context_layout_version` versions model-visible layout independently of JSONL format: loading an
  older layout converts legacy `created_at`, emits at most one checkpoint, advances the version,
  appends the resume event; the next snapshot persists an append-only delta.

## Terminal boundary

- Completed user/assistant/tool output prints into native terminal or tmux scrollback.
- Drafts, live previews, queue state, selectors, and status are one prompt-toolkit application on
  the primary screen; exclusive viewers like `/diff` may use the alternate screen and restore on
  exit.

**The terminal is a projection, not the source of transcript truth.** `tui/scrollback.py` owns
that projection. Its two mechanisms are inseparable:

- Completed writes scroll through a DEC region anchored at row 1 and ending strictly above the
  app. Live rows never participate in those writes. Compute the boundary and flush only inside
  the render cycle, with current geometry; hold output while no safe region exists. After the app
  stops, drain held writes directly before newer shutdown output; acceptance is not proof that a
  render occurred.
- At a fresh terminal's top, the renderer's height includes unused space below the live content.
  New output first advances the live origin into that space, bounded by the layout's preferred
  height. Erase only the established live region, fill the freed rows, then repaint the live
  layout at its new origin. Once the space is used, continue through the same DEC region.
  Guard visible recent output as well as native history: a complete scrollback alone can hide
  a transcript stuck in the first few screen rows.
- A width change invalidates row ownership. Purge the terminal and replay retained completed
  output, including startup/restored output and accepted pending writes. Defer the rebuild while
  an exclusive viewer owns the alternate screen, and pay the debt on return to the primary screen.
- Re-anchor the app at the pane bottom and give the renderer its origin directly. A resize CPR
  round trip reintroduces a race; the initial startup probe is a separate case.
- Record completed rule labels and styles before projection, but draw their length at the current
  width, including after batching. Do not infer UI rules from runs of dashes in user/model text,
  and do not replay elapsed-time or other live-state computations.
- Record using the output's selected color depth, as direct printing and live viewers do; freeze
  that choice for replay. A capture buffer must not force true color and change the visible palette.
- At opening, inline modal windows reserve up to six rows of recent output (less in small panes) and scroll
  to the selected item. Filling the pane pushes all preceding context into native history;
  closing the modal cannot bring it back. Do not add a purge/replay on modal close: preserving
  visible context must not expand the width-change cost to ordinary selector interactions.
  Snapshot the height bound at opening; querying terminal size again inside layout can mix two
  resize geometries in one frame. The parent clips the window if the pane subsequently shrinks.
- Adopt the CLI's preprinted startup output into the transcript without printing it again.
  Direct runtime callers install the sink before printing their banner, still before terminal
  probing. Early visibility must not bypass recording: replay cannot recover unrecorded output.

**Accepted cost:** the first width change removes pre-wizolt shell scrollback. `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
records what that costs users, and the evidence that the reference implementation of this design
pays the same price. Replay retains at
most 5,000 writes (a write can contain multiple lines); older output may disappear from terminal
history on rebuild. This is an ephemeral projection budget, not deletion of durable session
history. Do not promise that the terminal had already discarded those entries.

**Bounded repaint was tried and does not work.** Replacing the purge by redrawing only the rows
above the app looks reachable: the prototype's `physical_rows` and `wrap_rows` matched tmux's
wrapping in cases measured at 20/40/60/80/100 columns, and rows emitted individually rendered
byte-identically to the text they
were sliced from, styles carried across each split. In a quiet pane it works, and shell history
survives every width change. It still fails the acceptance suite, for a reason no arithmetic fixes:
a repaint can only rewrite the visible screen, while the transcript rows that have already scrolled
into native history stay as tmux reflowed them. The two versions then disagree at the seam and
markers are duplicated or lost. Locating our region also needs the reflowed extent of the app's own
rows, which is the ownership question the purge exists to avoid. Do not retry this without solving
the seam; a bounded repaint that only redraws the screen cannot be made consistent with history it
cannot reach.

**Superseded:** the earlier "never clear scrollback" rule and bottom re-anchor followed by CPR.
Erase-and-print leaves live rows in terminal text flow; estimated line deletion can destroy
transcript. Moving ordinary selectors or the whole app to the alternate screen changes the
accepted product behavior. Alternate-screen selectors also lost primary history across repeated
transitions; fixed-height selectors sacrificed usability, and floating selectors did not prove
physical-history preservation. Neither a clean first resize nor stable preferred height establishes
row ownership. The full investigation remains in Git history before deletion of the issue log.

The projection relies on measured tmux behavior: a row-1 scroll region feeds native history and
pane reflow keeps the cursor line at the bottom. These are not terminal-protocol guarantees.
Completed messages are recorded as `MessageBlock` -- their text, role and indent -- and Rich lays
them out again for the width they are projected into, so Markdown, tables, lists and code re-flow
on a resize rather than having the bytes of an earlier width re-wrapped by character. Rules do the
same through `HorizontalRule`, and log blocks -- tool output, code, diffs -- through `LogBlockCell`, whose diff
gutter and changed-text column are sized from the pane. All three derive from `WidthDependent`:
subclass it whenever a block's layout depends on the width, and record the block rather than its
rendering. Plain text needs no cell, because `segments` never wraps and the terminal re-flows it.

**Guard at two levels.** Unit/model tests cover geometry refusal, deferred replay, output recording,
ordering and shutdown. Real-tmux tests must cover repeated wide/narrow and tall/short transitions,
inspect narrow as well as restored-wide captures, and separately assert transcript completeness,
uniqueness, single-row rules and bounded blank-row growth. Do not substitute a synthetic terminal
or a clean final wide capture for physical history. Run the acceptance tests against both CI's
system tmux and its explicitly pinned second version; neither proves all terminal emulators.
Changes to the renderer, output batching, startup recording or modal ownership must run these
checks. A regression test must fail against the implementation preceding its fix.

`tests/test_tui_tmux_scrollback.py` currently checks 30 size transitions with split-pane zoom/unzoom,
slow and rapid pauses, completed marker output, repeated inline modals, prompt/status uniqueness,
blank-row growth, adaptive rules and ordered output on exit. Long inline selectors additionally
cover navigation to the last choice, search, selection/cancellation and visible context after
repeated closes in small and normal panes, without discarding shell history. It runs with alternate-screen support
on and off. `tests/test_tui_scrollback_region.py` and `tests/test_tui_transcript_recording.py` guard
geometry, recording and shutdown boundaries with a terminal model or captured output.
The real CLI startup path is also grown and shrunk repeatedly with only its banner and an
unsubmitted draft; both the banner and the live frame must remain single-copy.

**Remaining acceptance coverage:** changing thinking/activity previews, Ask/approval interactions,
and selectors with rich previews still need real-tmux coverage. Future changes at those boundaries
must additionally verify:

- Seeded transcript markers survive exactly once in `tmux capture-pane -p -S -` through at least
  30 slow and rapid resize/zoom cycles; shell markers may disappear under the accepted purge.
- The active frame remains single-copy, total captured rows do not grow with resize count, and
  repeated selectors remain usable at small, normal and large sizes with previews and long lists.
- Ctrl-C, Esc, Enter, search and resize remain responsive, with alternate-screen support both on
  and off, and retained transcript remains accessible after exit.

Passing the existing harness does not prove these remaining interactions or all terminal emulators.

## Compaction

Compaction is the deliberate persisted exception to send-time-only projection: it replaces old
active messages with a summary when the effective request, including tools, reaches the input
budget.

It rewrites only model messages and their recall indexes — never the completed transcript or its
tool/diff replay metadata, even when the active turn is compacted.

- Compact prior history first; the active turn only if the rebuilt request is still too large.
- Keep the latest user boundary and a recent tail; never split assistant tool calls from their
  results. That boundary is what protects the request a turn is executing, so a user message the
  runtime generates itself — a mention expansion, a protocol correction — is marked as a session
  event and does not become the boundary; otherwise it inherits the protection and the request it
  was appended to is summarized away mid-turn.
- Feed the previous summary and structured goal/plan/known/checks to the compactor explicitly; an
  old summary is not ordinary conversation to summarize again; each evicted span is captured once.
- Store a bounded verbatim excerpt as a `seg.N` segment; replace the evicted prefix with one
  checkpoint (summary + working state + segment pointer); prune `tr.N` records by the surviving
  reachability set.
- On model compaction failure, fall back to deterministic trimming with an explicit marker that
  never enters the live answer preview.
- Compaction cannot fit an oversized fixed prefix, latest user boundary, tool schema set, or single
  retained object: bound at the owner or fail clearly; deleting protocol structure does not make a
  request valid.

## Cache test boundary

Cache behavior is tested through the real Agent and SDK request serialization against a test-only
OpenAI HTTP behavior model (both APIs, implicit breakpoints, longest exact-prefix reads,
stable-key scopes, read/write usage); black-box cases cover multi-turn growth,
Note/tool-result boundaries, resume, one compaction epoch, and model-scope changes. The mock is a
deterministic contract test, not evidence a live provider retained a prefix for any duration or
threshold; provider integration tests verify reported usage and acceptance without replacing it.

## Failure boundaries

- Retry only bounded, plausibly transient model failures. Cancellation, capability rejection,
  validation errors, and generation deadlines are not retry signals. The retry **decision** is
  fixed; only **pacing** is flexible: backoff with jitter, honoring `Retry-After`, never stalling
  the CLI.
- Cancellation is a control signal, not a state mutation from another thread: it cancels the turn's
  own task and propagates to what that task awaits, and the owning turn settles or retracts its
  records (see "One loop owns the session").
- Tool failures become matched tool results, not broken turns; cancellation settles every
  already-visible call so replay stays valid.
- Job stdin is opt-in. Writes are unbuffered, nonblocking and at most the platform's `PIPE_BUF`
  (also capped at 4 KiB), so a full pipe rejects the entire answer without blocking the loop or
  leaving bytes queued for a later call. `BackgroundJob` closes stdin when it observes exit;
  the tool exposes the exact input through the existing approval viewer.
- Edit target validation is a safety boundary, not friction. Under a source view, Edit may target
  only lines the model was shown; changed or ambiguously moved targets stay refused, while a unique
  exact relocation is accepted. Without one, the exact original text the call supplies is a
  compare-and-swap condition that must match the current file exactly once -- missing, repeated, or
  mutually overlapping targets refuse the whole call rather than picking a location. A call uses one
  evidence mode, and a path may not change modes inside one planned batch: character replacements
  cannot carry a view's line origins. Success and a failure the file can answer return a fresh
  bounded view so same-file runs continue.
- Lower layers contain recoverable detail: retained output supports recall, snapshots support
  resume, deterministic compaction preserves progress when the summarizer is unavailable.

## Worker handoff

A worker is the same process's second wizolt session, driven serially by the parent through one
`Delegate` tool call per round: a full wizolt (compaction, Recall, tr.N, Job, Skill, MCP, diff,
confirmation, snapshots) with its own system prompt and reduced tool list. The worker never
reaches back. Three decisions are easy to reopen; their reasons follow.

**No worker-to-parent tool calls.** A reverse call would re-enter the parent's `Agent.run` mid-turn;
the agent loop is the serialized writer of active-turn messages (see "Context is a projection"), so
a second writer would corrupt `_active_turn_messages` and the checkpoint, and the parent could not
settle its own interrupt meanwhile. The worker's channel back is its final text; questions end its
turn.

**Worker snapshots are subordinate; reset discards process, not product.** The worker uid is
`parent.uid + ".w"`, keying its log/meta/assets by the parent's identity: listings, latest-pointer
resolution, and expiry skip or cascade over them; reset derives its delete path from the parent's
uid (the model's arguments carry no path). Reset drops the worker's context and cached agent — the
wrong beliefs accumulated across failed delegations — while file changes and merged diffs belong to
the repo and survive.

**The worker's cache prefix is a per-session constant.** The order must be the worker's first user
message, never spliced into its system prompt, or every delegation starts a fresh cache epoch. The
worker inherits the parent's `created_at` (Environment byte-identical across spawns), keeps its
tool list fixed, and shares the parent's SkillLibrary/MCPManager so no index changes between
delegations.
