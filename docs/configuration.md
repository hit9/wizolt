# Configuration

wizolt reads a single TOML file, `~/.wizolt/config.toml` by default. Generate a
commented starter with `wizolt --init-config`, or point at another file with
`--config <path>`.

<span class="marker">Only the `[provider]` block is required.</span> Every other key falls back to
a built-in default, so a minimal config is just a provider. Inspect the resolved configuration
at any time with `/config`.

## Providers

wizolt supports OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Responses APIs, plus the Anthropic
Messages API. Define one or more `[provider.<name>]` blocks and select one with
`[provider] active`:

```toml
[provider]
active = "default"

[provider.default]
url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
key = "sk-..."
model = "deepseek-flash"
```

These three fields are enough for most endpoints. wizolt selects the usual protocol and applies
only necessary, documented compatibility adjustments. Explicit settings always take precedence.
Use `/config` to inspect the result. [Compatibility catalog](catalog.md) explains which provider
and model facts wizolt maintains, how they update, and what happens to unknown endpoints.

Define additional blocks to use more providers. Switch between them with `/provider [NAME]`, and
switch the active model with `/model [MODEL]`.

### API protocol

Leave `api = "auto"` unless your endpoint needs an explicit protocol:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Infer the protocol when possible; otherwise use Chat Completions |
| `chat` | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions |
| `responses` | OpenAI-compatible Responses |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic-compatible Messages |

A URL ending in `/chat/completions`, `/responses`, or `/messages` also selects that protocol.

### Optional provider settings

Most users can leave these unset.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | `auto` | API protocol shown above |
| `stream` | `true` | Stream model output; disable for endpoints that reject streaming or Chat `stream_options` |
| `reasoning` | `medium` | Reasoning effort: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; change it during a session with `/reason` |
| `available_models` | — | Additional models shown by `/model` |
| `temperature` | — | Sampling temperature; omitted by default |
| `max_tokens` | `0` | Output-token cap per model request, reasoning included; `0` uses the cap the endpoint is known to need (Anthropic 8K, Volcengine Ark 128K or the model's lower ceiling) and otherwise leaves it to the provider. 16K is still reserved from the input budget for the answer, trading against `max_context_tokens` one for one |
| `max_context_tokens` | `0` | How much of *this* entry's model window to use; `0` inherits `runtime.max_context_tokens`. Set it per entry when entries point at models with different windows |
| `timeout` | `120` | Transport inactivity timeout in seconds |
| `response_timeout` | `600` | Total generation limit in seconds; `0` disables it |
| `prompt_cache_key` | `auto` | Stable prompt-cache key; set `off` to omit it |
| `strict_tools` | `false` | Request strict function schemas where supported; toggle with `/strict` |
| `headers` | `{}` | Extra HTTP headers sent with every request to this entry; see below |
| `omit_body` | `[]` | Request fields this endpoint rejects; see below |
| `extra_body` | `{}` | Extra fields for an OpenAI-compatible request body. Fields inside an object wizolt also manages are merged rather than replacing it, so `extra_body.reasoning.context` reaches a Responses host without dropping the resolved effort |
| `builtin_tools` | `[]` | Tools the provider runs itself, passed through verbatim; see below |
| `chat_reasoning` | `auto` | Provider-specific Chat reasoning format; normally leave on `auto` |
| `reasoning_history` | `auto` | Reasoning replay policy on Chat, Responses, and Anthropic: catalog-selected by default; `all`, `current_turn`, or `tool_calls` explicitly overrides it |

### Extra HTTP headers

Some features live in the header rather than the request body, where `extra_body` cannot reach
them. `headers` sends whatever the provider documents alongside every request from that entry:

```toml
[provider.cmd]
url = "https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1"
key = "..."
model = "deepseek/deepseek-flash"
headers = { x-cmd-zdr = "1" }   # Command Code: route only to zero-retention upstreams
```

Values are ASCII strings or plain integers. `key` still supplies authentication, so a header is
only needed for what the provider documents separately — zero-retention routing, a gateway's
tenant or routing key. The same headers are used when `/model` asks the endpoint for its model
list. `/config` lists the headers in effect.

### Fields an endpoint rejects

Some endpoints answer `400` for a field wizolt sends. Name it in `omit_body` and it is left out:

```toml
[provider.gw]
omit_body = ["reasoning_effort", "stream_options"]
```

`extra_body` is the other half — it adds fields, `omit_body` removes them. A name is dropped
wherever it sits in the request. `model`, `messages`, `input`, and `stream` cannot be removed;
use `stream = false` when an endpoint does not stream. `/config` lists what is being omitted.

Streaming is enabled by default for all three protocols. If a compatible endpoint does not
support it, set `stream = false` in that provider block, or use `/set provider.stream off` for
the current session.

`timeout` detects a connection that stops delivering data. Streaming reasoning can keep that
timer active indefinitely, so `response_timeout` separately limits the complete model response to
ten minutes by default. Reaching the total limit cancels the request without automatic retries;
set it to `0` only when deliberately allowing unbounded generations.

`/reason` offers the levels the active model documents, and sends the one you pick. DeepSeek
models offer `off, low, high, max`; a model wizolt has no evidence about keeps the full scale
(`minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max`). Unknown OpenAI-compatible endpoints and model names
stay on the generic path rather than an allowlist; set `api` and `chat_reasoning` explicitly if
automatic selection is wrong. `/config` lists the levels in `provider.supported_reasoning`, while
`/status` shows the active model and cache usage reported by the provider.

When the list is shorter than the full scale, `/reason` shows why underneath it, with the page it
came from:

```
Reasoning effort
   1. off - disable reasoning
   2. low
   3. high
   4. max
  ──────────────────────────────────
  │ Why these levels
  │ DeepSeek documents low/high/max; medium and xhigh are served as high
  │ https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode/
```

Switching model or provider can leave an effort the new model has no level for. wizolt moves it
to the nearest one and says so once:

```
Reasoning medium is not offered by deepseek-flash, using high
```

### Effort levels a model accepts

When wizolt's list is wrong for your model, say what the model accepts. Write the levels weakest
first, under a model name or a glob:

```toml
[provider.gw.models]
"gpt-5.6*" = { reasoning = ["low", "medium", "high", "ultra"] }
```

Those levels become what `/reason` offers for models the glob matches, replacing wizolt's own.
They can include names wizolt does not know — `ultra` above — since they are sent as written.
Each list must contain unique levels and must not include `off`; wizolt adds `off` unless the
catalog documents that the model always reasons. Worker and compaction reasoning overrides use
the scale declared for their effective model too.

## Provider-side tools

Some providers can run web search themselves; see
[Provider-side tools](tools.md#provider-side-tools) for what that looks like in a session. List
the ones you want in `builtin_tools`, written the way your provider documents them:

```toml
[provider]
url = "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
model = "qwen3-max"
api = "responses"
builtin_tools = [{ type = "web_search" }, { type = "web_extractor" }]
```

| Provider | Entry |
|---|---|
| OpenAI (Responses) | `{ type = "web_search" }`, optionally with `search_context_size` or `filters` |
| Qwen (Responses) | `{ type = "web_search" }`; also `web_extractor` |
| Anthropic | `{ type = "web_search_20250305", name = "web_search", max_uses = 5 }` |
| Z.AI / BigModel | `{ type = "web_search", web_search = { enable = "True" } }` |
| Kimi / Moonshot | `{ type = "builtin_function", function = { name = "$web_search" } }` |
| OpenRouter | `{ type = "openrouter:web_search" }`; also `openrouter:web_fetch`, `openrouter:datetime` |

One provider configures search elsewhere, through [`extra_body`](#optional-provider-settings):
Qwen's Chat Completions endpoint takes `enable_search`. DeepSeek has no web search.

Builtin tools only work with the APIs shown in the table. If you switch to another API, wizolt
keeps the setting but does not send those tools; switching back enables them again. Use `/config`
to check whether they are active. If wizolt reports an unsupported entry, compare it with the
example for your provider.

## Vision model

An optional `[vision]` entry gives image input a fallback when the active model is text-only:

```toml
[vision]
provider = "vision"

[provider.vision]
url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
key = "sk-..."
model = "deepseek-flash"
```

An attached image is first sent to the active model unless wizolt knows it rejects images:
documented text-only families from a static catalog, or the same model returning HTTP 400 for an
image in this session. In those cases `[vision]` describes the image once and its text replaces
the raw image, and `ViewImage` falls back the same way. Each fallback description costs one
vision-model request. Without `[vision]`, a text-only route keeps sending to the active model and
you see the provider's own error.

## Hooks

Use `[hooks]` to run shell commands at session, tool, turn, worker and compaction boundaries.
For example, record failed Bash calls:

```toml
[[hooks.PostToolUseFailure]]
matcher = "Bash"
hooks = [{ type = "command", command = "~/bin/log-tool-failure.sh", timeout = 10 }]
```

Each hook has its own `timeout` in seconds (default 60), independent of `runtime.shell_timeout`.
wizolt waits for matching commands to finish. See [Hooks](hooks.md) for all 13 events and their
input and output formats; `/status` shows the number of active hooks.

## Runtime

Optional; the defaults shown are used when omitted.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `yolo` | `false` | Start without confirmation prompts |
| `max_context_tokens` | `262144` (256K) | Default for every provider entry that does not set its own `max_context_tokens`. How much of the model's context window to use, which sets the automatic-compaction budget — a budget, not the window's size: raise it for a 1M-window model, lower it for a smaller one |
| `max_agent_steps` | `400` | Maximum tool steps in one turn |
| `shell_timeout` | `60` | Maximum shell-command lifetime, in seconds |
| `bash_wait_timeout` | `10` | Foreground wait before a running command becomes a background job; `0` disables promotion |
| `max_parallel_tools` | `4` | Maximum read-only tool calls executed concurrently; `1` disables parallelism |
| `session_retention_days` | `7` | Delete saved sessions untouched for this many days, swept in the background at startup; `0` keeps them indefinitely |
| `theme` | `auto` | Color theme: `auto`, `light`, `dark`, or a named theme (see [Color themes](#color-themes)); overridden by `--theme`, and set for you by `/theme`. `auto` asks the terminal for its background color, then reads `COLORFGBG`, and falls back to `dark` |
| `worker` | `false` | Let the model delegate to a second in-process session; see below |
| `language` | `auto` | Force the reply language (`auto` follows your messages and injects nothing); set a name like `Chinese` to append a fixed `LANGUAGE OVERRIDE` block to the system prompt. Change for the current session with `/language` |
| `attribution` | `true` | Ask the model to end every commit message and pull-request body it writes with `Generated with [wizolt](https://wizolt.readthedocs.io).` — a prompt-level request, not a guarantee. `/set runtime.attribution off` stops it for the session, `false` for good |
| `agents_md` | `true` | Inject your instructions into every request, as one block of their own ahead of the skills and MCP indexes: the global `~/.wizolt/AGENTS.md` followed by the project's `AGENTS.md` files (each falling back to `CLAUDE.md`) from the repository root down to the working directory, together bounded to about 8,000 tokens |

Selected tuning values can be changed for the current session with `/set` (Tab completion
lists the supported keys). `/yolo` toggles `yolo`.

### Color themes

`dark` and `light` draw in your terminal's own colors, so they follow whatever scheme your
terminal is set to. The named themes pin every color to a well-known scheme instead — code
highlighting, the status bar, menus and the selection band included:

`gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `nord`, `dracula`,
`one-dark`, `monokai`, `github-dark`

Try `monokai` for vivid pink, green and cyan on a warm dark background, or `github-dark` for
GitHub-style colors on a near-black background.

A named theme does not change your terminal's background, so pick the one that matches it. Use
`/theme` to preview code, status colors, menu text and selected rows. Hints and menu descriptions
stay readable while separators remain quieter. `gruvbox` and `solarized` pick their dark or light variant to match
your terminal, the way `auto` does; so does any name you give both a `-dark` and a `-light` theme
file. Named themes, and theme files based on one, draw their exact colors when your terminal
sets `COLORTERM=truecolor` (most modern terminals do); otherwise each color is the nearest of 256.
`NO_COLOR=1` turns color off everywhere, keeping bold and the selection bar.

To make your own, add `<data_dir>/themes/<name>.toml` (`~/.wizolt/themes/` by default). It starts
from a built-in theme and changes only the colors you list:

```toml
base = "gruvbox-dark"         # any built-in theme; default "dark"
pygments = "monokai"          # optional: the Pygments style for code
[colors]
accent = "#83a598"            # "#rrggbb", "#rgb", "default", or a terminal color like "ansicyan"
user = "ansiyellow"
```

The roles you can set are `text`, `muted`, `subtle`, `accent`, `accent_secondary`, `info`,
`user`, `tool`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `rule`, the code colors `syntax_assign`,
`syntax_string`, `syntax_number`, `syntax_ident`, `syntax_builtin` and `syntax_default`, the
status bar's `status_base`, `status_provider`, `status_reason`, `status_mcp`, `status_context`,
`status_yolo` and `status_worker`, the working divider's `divider_glow` and `divider_rule` (these
two take `#rrggbb` only), and `selection_bg`, `selection_fg`, `menu_bg` and `menu_muted` (the
completion menu's descriptions).

Diffs keep the base theme's red and green unless a `[diff]` table recolors them. If red and green
are hard to tell apart for you, blue and orange are a common replacement:

```toml
[diff]
added = "#003a66"          # the added line
added_word = "#0061a8"     # the words it changed
removed = "#5c3300"
removed_word = "#a35a00"
```

The file name is the theme's name, so it cannot be a built-in theme, `auto`, or a pair's name
(`gruvbox`, or `mine` once `mine-dark` and `mine-light` exist). A mistake in a theme file is
reported at startup and when `/theme` opens; the rest of the file still applies. `/theme` re-reads the folder each time it opens, so edits show up without a restart.

## Statusbar and divider

Use `/statusbar` to preview a statusbar preset. `/divider` opens a menu with **Layout presets**
and **Sweep presets** submenus. Moving the selection previews it; Enter saves it. Esc restores
what you had and returns to the parent menu. Divider previews include idle, running and queued
examples, so you can try animations without sending a model request.

```toml
[ui.statusbar]
format = "preset:powerline"

[ui.divider]
format = "preset:comet"
sweep = "preset:comet"
```

| Setting | Presets |
| --- | --- |
| `statusbar.format` | `default` (the usual status row), `minimal` (model and context), `split` (left/right groups), `powerline` (joined color segments) |
| `divider.format` | `comet` (activity with a waiting dot), `plain` (activity and a rule), `minimal` (activity only while running), `powerline` (activity and metrics segments) |
| `divider.sweep` | `comet` (back and forth), `scan` (left to right), `breathe` (pulsing line), `none` |

The defaults are `preset:default`, `preset:comet` and `preset:comet`. Layout and sweep are
independent: a sweep colors the divider's fill region only while running. Powerline requires a
font containing `` and ``; the other presets need no special font.

`/statusbar powerline` and `/divider minimal` select layouts directly. `/statusbar export` and
`/divider export` print the current settings with presets expanded into editable TOML.
After editing your config, use `/statusbar reload` or `/divider reload` to reload all three settings.
A failed reload keeps your current layout; invalid settings at startup use the defaults.

### Custom templates

Replace a `preset:name` value with a template. The statusbar and divider use the same syntax:

```toml
[ui.statusbar]
format = "[status_provider]{model}[/]{>}[muted]ctx {context.percent}%[/]"

[ui.divider]
format = "{% if running %}[accent bold]{activity}[/] · {elapsed:duration} {% endif %}[subtle]{fill:─}[/]"
sweep = "preset:none"
```

| Syntax | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `{model}` | Insert a field as plain text |
| `{elapsed:duration}` | Seconds followed by `s`; numbers also accept `:d` and `:.0f` through `:.6f` |
| `[accent bold]…[/]` | Theme color or highlight group, with optional text attributes; `[/]` restores the previous style |
| `[fg=#fff bg=#333 bold]…[/]` | Explicit foreground, background and attributes; colors can also name theme roles |
| `[reset]` | Restore terminal defaults |
| `{>}` | Push the remaining content to the right |
| `{fill:─}` | Fill the remaining width with a single-column character |
| `{join:}` / `{join:}` | Join adjacent background colors automatically |
| `{% if worker.active %}…{% else %}…{% endif %}` | Conditional content; `else` is optional |
| `{% optional priority=10 %}…{% endoptional %}` | Omit the whole span when space is short; lower priorities go first |

Use at most one `{>}` or `{fill:…}` in a rendered line. Include a separator inside its optional
span so both disappear together. Remaining text is clipped to one terminal row, preserving the
right-hand group where possible. Close styles inside conditional and optional spans. Double
brackets to print them literally: `{{`, `}}`, `[[`, `]]`.

Conditions support comparisons, parentheses, `and`, `or` and `not`. For example:

```text
{% if context.percent >= 80 %}[warning bold]ctx {context.percent}%[/]{% else %}[muted]ctx {context.percent}%[/]{% endif %}
```

Available fields:

| Fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `provider`, `model`, `reasoning`, `context.percent`, `cache.percent` | Current agent; during delegation these follow the worker |
| `yolo`, `mcp.count`, `mcp.label`, `skills.count` | Session settings and connected services; `mcp.label` includes discovery activity |
| `worker.active`, `worker.model`, `worker.context`, `worker.summary` | Worker activity, model, context percentage, and the parked worker's context label |
| `running`, `elapsed`, `rate` | Whether the agent is running, seconds since the turn started, and the current output-rate label |
| `activity`, `spinner`, `label` | Divider activity, waiting dot, and the complete activity/elapsed/queue label used by default |
| `queue.total`, `queue.followup`, `queue.next_turn`, `reset_pending` | Divider queue counts and pending context reset |

Divider-specific fields are populated by the divider; the statusbar supplies neutral values for
them. Put fields such as `rate` inside conditions when you want to omit their surrounding text
while they are empty. Field contents never become template instructions.

### Powerline colors

Built-in Powerline templates use the highlight groups `status.model`, `status.detail`,
`status.usage`, `divider.activity` and `divider.metrics`. They follow the selected color theme.
Override them, or define your own groups, in a theme file:

```toml
base = "github-dark"

[highlights."status.model"]
fg = "#0d1117"
bg = "#79c0ff"
bold = true
```

Highlight groups accept `fg`, `bg`, `bold`, `italic` and `underline`. Reload theme files with
`/theme`. A custom Powerline template can then be one string:

```toml
[ui.statusbar]
format = "[status.model] {model} {join:}[status.detail] {reasoning} {join:}[reset]{>}{join:}[status.usage] ctx {context.percent}% [reset]"
```

### Sweep formulas

A sweep is a brightness formula: `x` is the current terminal column, `t` is elapsed seconds, and
`w` is the divider width. Its result is clamped to `0..1`, blending `divider_rule` with
`divider_glow`. Labels cover the light without interrupting its movement.

```toml
[ui.divider]
sweep = "exp(-((x - pingpong(t * 18, w)) / 8) ** 2)"
```

This produces a broad glow moving back and forth at 18 columns per second. Change `18` for speed
or `8` for width. `pingpong(value, width)` reflects motion at the ends; `sin`, `cos`, `exp`,
`sqrt`, `abs`, `min` and `max` are also available, with arithmetic including `%` and `**`.
Use `"0"` or `"preset:none"` to stop the sweep.

Formulas are limited mathematical expressions, not Python scripts. Invalid formulas report an
error. If a formula becomes undefined while running, the affected light goes dark; the divider
preview displays the error. Templates are limited to 8,192 characters, formulas to 1,024.

## Worker delegation

The `Delegate` tool and `/worker` command hand bounded tasks to a second in-process session.
Concepts, quick start, and what you see in the terminal: [Worker delegation](worker.md).

Worker keys inherit the `[worker]` provider entry by default:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[worker] provider` | — | Worker provider entry key; unset disables delegation |
| `[worker] model` | inherit | Override the entry's model; empty inherits |
| `[worker] reasoning` | inherit | Override the entry's reasoning effort; empty inherits |
| `[worker] api` | inherit | Override the entry's wire protocol; empty inherits |

`[runtime] worker` and `[runtime] language` are in the [Runtime](#runtime) table above.

## Compaction model

Context compaction (the summary request that makes room in the context window) runs on the active
provider by default. A `[compaction]` section overrides it per field, mirroring `[worker]`: an
empty `provider` means the active provider entry, and each empty override inherits that entry's
value. The context budget is unaffected — requests are still prepared against the active
provider's window; only the summary request itself uses this entry.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[compaction] provider` | inherit | Base provider entry key; empty = the active provider |
| `[compaction] model` | inherit | Override the entry's model; empty inherits |
| `[compaction] reasoning` | inherit | Override the entry's reasoning effort; empty inherits |
| `[compaction] api` | inherit | Override the entry's wire protocol; empty inherits |

Each provider entry can also nest its own `compaction` table (`[provider.NAME.compaction]`) with
the same `model`/`reasoning`/`api` keys — there is no `provider` key there, the base entry comes
only from the global `[compaction] provider`. Per field the most specific value wins: the base
entry's nested table, then the global `[compaction]` section, then the entry's own value.

```toml
[provider.anthropic]
model = "claude-..."

  [provider.anthropic.compaction]
  model = "claude-haiku-..."
```

Write the nested table under a *named* entry, as above. In the short single-provider form, where
`[provider]` holds `url` and `key` directly, `[provider.compaction]` reads as a provider named
`compaction` and the config is rejected with `provider.active does not exist`.

Summaries can also run on a different vendor entirely — the entry supplies its own url, key, and
wire protocol, so the conversation stays on one host while summaries go to another:

```toml
[provider]
active = "anthropic"

[provider.anthropic]
url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
key = "sk-ant-..."
model = "claude-..."

[provider.deepseek]
url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
key = "sk-..."
model = "deepseek-..."

[compaction]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-...-flash"
reasoning = "off"
```

Two things to check when picking a summarizer:

- **Its window must fit the span being compacted.** A small-window model asked to summarize a
  large conversation fails every time, and the context is then trimmed without a summary.
- **Its `response_timeout` applies to the summary.** A slow summarizer holds up the turn for that
  long before giving up. Lower it on that entry if you would rather trim early than wait.

`/config` shows the effective `compaction.*` values, and `/compact log` records which model
produced each stored segment. Summary
tokens are counted apart from the conversation, on their own `compaction usage` row in `/status`,
so each row can be read against one model's price.

## Data location

```toml
[paths]
data_dir = "~/.wizolt"   # sessions, input history, OAuth tokens, user skills, themes, update cache
```

Sessions live under `<data_dir>/projects/<project>/`, one directory per working directory. Each
holds that project's session logs and a `latest` pointer, so a resume stays scoped to the project
it belongs to. A project directory is removed once its last session expires.

Beside each log sits a small `<uid>.meta.json` holding what the session picker shows — name,
opening line, round count. The log stays the source of truth; deleting a sidecar only costs that
session its label in the list.

`<data_dir>/history.txt` holds the input history that Up and Ctrl-P recall, across every project.
It is capped at 512 KB, keeping the most recent entries.
