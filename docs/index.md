wizolt works in your terminal: you describe a task, and it reads code, edits files, runs
commands, and reports back. It keeps <span class="marker">stable prompt prefixes</span> so
supported providers can reuse work, maintains a searchable code index, runs background jobs,
tracks its own working notes, and <span class="marker">resumes where you left off</span>.

Wizolt is the former minacode, which began as the single-file nanocode. The project history remains
continuous across those names.

```{admonition} Use at your own risk
:class: warning
wizolt edits files and runs shell commands in the directory where you start it. It has
**no sandbox of its own**. Run it inside a container, VM, or another isolated environment
when you need isolation. See [Safety](safety.md).
```

## Install and run

```sh
uv tool install wizolt
wizolt --init-config          # write ~/.wizolt/config.toml
# add your provider's url, key, and model to that file
wizolt
```

| Area | In short |
|---|---|
| **[Interaction](usage.md)** | Follow-ups, streaming, keys — how you drive the agent. |
| **[Commands](commands.md)** | The `/` command reference: status, models, sessions, MCP. |
| **[Tools](tools.md)** | Read, search, navigate code; edit files; run commands; background jobs; optional provider-side web search. |
| **[Sessions](usage.md#sessions)** | Your work is saved, named, and resumable with `/sessions`, `-c`, or `--resume`. |
| **[MCP](mcp.md)** | Connect external Model Context Protocol servers and use their tools. |
| **[Worker](worker.md)** | Delegate bounded tasks to a second in-process session on its own provider, with context kept until reset. |
| **[Skills](skills.md)** | Load reusable instruction packs on demand. |
| **[Configuration](configuration.md)** | Providers, runtime settings, and data location. |
| **[Compatibility catalog](catalog.md)** | How documented provider/model exceptions are selected, updated, and overridden. |
| **[Context](context.md)** | How the window is filled, summarized when it fills up, and reused by the provider's cache. |
| **[Safety](safety.md)** | What wizolt can reach, and how to keep that bounded. |
| **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)** | What a symptom means and what to do about it. |
