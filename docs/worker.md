# Worker delegation

A **worker** is a second wizolt session running in the same process. When the model meets a
bounded task that deserves an independent look — a review, a refactor, a second opinion — it hands
the task over with the `Delegate` tool.

The worker has its own provider, its own system prompt, and a reduced tool set, and keeps its
context across delegations until you reset it. It never calls back into the parent: a delegation
is a detour that ends by returning its result.

The point is pairing models by cost. A large model orchestrates as the parent; the worker's tasks
arrive already bounded and spec'd, so a small cheap model handles them at a fraction of the
parent's rate.

## Quick start

The parent orchestrates, so it usually runs the larger model; the worker runs bounded tasks,
so a faster, cheaper entry is enough for it — ideally from a **different vendor** than
`provider.active`, so its reviews cross-validate the parent's. Point `[worker] provider` at
that entry and turn on `[runtime] worker`:

```toml
[provider]
active = "default"

[provider.default]
url = "https://api.openai.com"
key = "sk-..."
model = "gpt-5.5"

# A faster, cheaper entry for the worker, from a different vendor.
[provider.deepseek]
url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
key = "sk-..."
model = "deepseek-flash"

[worker]
provider = "deepseek"    # worker provider key; unset disables delegation
model = ""               # optional: override the entry's model (inherit by default)
reasoning = ""           # optional: override the entry's reasoning effort (inherit by default)
api = ""                 # optional: override the entry's wire protocol (inherit by default)

[runtime]
worker = true            # or /worker on
```

The model decides when to delegate. When it does, it writes the `order` itself and asks you to
approve the send; the worker then takes over the terminal until it answers, and its answer goes
back to the parent, which decides what to do next.

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/worker` | Show its provider, model, state, and rounds |
| `/worker on` · `/worker off` | Allow or stop delegation for this session |
| `/worker reset` | Clear the worker's context |
| `/worker provider NAME` | Point it at another provider entry |
| `/worker model` · `reason` · `api` | Override one field of that entry; `default` restores it |

[Commands](commands.md) has the full syntax.

## What you see

### The delegation bracket

Two full-width rules bracket a delegation: a yellow `worker start` rule with the worker's live
provider and model plus the order's title (or first line), the worker's streamed lines, then a
yellow `worker done` rule with the step count, elapsed time, tokens in and out, and the files it
touched.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The delegation bracket: a full-width yellow worker start rule naming the worker's provider, model, and order title, a few worker tool lines beneath it, and a yellow worker done rule with step count, elapsed time, token counts, and touched files."><span class="fs-worker">──── worker start · deepseek/deepseek-flash · Review the parser refactor ───────</span><span class="fs-tool">  ├ Read wizolt/loop.py</span><span class="fs-tool">  ├ Read tests/test_edit_tool.py</span><span class="fs-tool">  └ Bash uv run pytest tests/ -q</span><span class="fs-worker">──── worker done · steps 7 · 43.2s · 12.4K in / 1.1K out · wizolt/loop.py, tests/ ────</span></div>

### The send approval brief

Every `Delegate send` asks for approval, even under `yolo` — the confirmation prints the title, a
one-line excerpt of the order, any explicit `language` or `max_steps`, and the effective worker
provider/model/effort/api, with `(inherit)` marking a field that inherits the provider entry's
value. A refused send feeds your reason back to the model.

The actions sit in a row above the input line, `Approve` selected to begin with. `Tab` and the
arrows move the highlight — above, two presses have landed on `View order` — and `Enter` fires
whatever is highlighted:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | do the selected action — `Approve` unless you moved |
| `Tab` / `→` / `Shift-Tab` / `←` | move along the row |
| `Esc` | refuse without a reason |
| anything printable | start writing a refusal reason |

Typing always goes to the reason, so no letter is ever a shortcut and no reason is unwritable. While
you are typing, the row dims and `Enter` sends the reason instead; `Esc` takes the reason back and
returns to the row, and refuses only once there is nothing left to take back.

Every tool's approval works this way — non-`Delegate` ones simply offer `Approve` and `Refuse`.
Without a TUI (piped input, a headless run) the row is gone and the same actions are typed out:
`y`, `n`, `v`, `c`, each followed by Enter.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The Delegate send approval brief: field rows for the title, an order excerpt, and the worker's effective provider, model, effort and api with inherit markers, then the action row in yellow with View order highlighted in reverse after two presses of Tab, and the reason input line below it."><span class="fs-tool">Delegate send</span><span> </span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">title    </span>Review the parser refactor</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">order    </span>Extract parser.py from loop.py, keep the CLI surface unchanged (… 3 more lines)</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">provider </span>(inherit) deepseek</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">model    </span>(inherit) deepseek-flash</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">effort   </span>(inherit) medium</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">api      </span>(inherit) chat</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">    │ </span><span class="fs-i fs-approve"> Approve </span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">  </span><span class="fs-i fs-approve-on"> View order </span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">  </span><span class="fs-i fs-approve"> Worker config </span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">  </span><span class="fs-i fs-approve"> Refuse </span><span class="fs-i fs-dim">    Tab to move</span></span><span class="fs-dim">  reason › </span></div>

`View order` opens the full order in a read-only viewer — the same field rows, then the order
itself rendered as markdown. Scroll it, then `Esc` back to the actions. After the delegation has
run, `Ctrl-O` reopens the same order with the worker's answer below it, which is where you judge
one against the other: the transcript keeps only the `Delegate send` line.

<div class="term-shot" role="img" aria-label="The order viewer opened from View order: a read-only header, the same field rows as the brief with cyan labels, a rule, then the full order rendered as markdown with an underlined heading, inline code, and a bullet list, above a line of scrolling keys."><span class="fs-dim">  Delegate order · read-only</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">  title   </span>  Review the parser refactor</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">  language</span>  python</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">  provider</span>  (inherit) deepseek</span><span><span class="fs-i fs-sel">  model   </span>  (inherit) deepseek-flash</span><span class="fs-dim">  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────</span><span>  <span class="fs-i fs-md-h">Review the parser refactor</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>  Extract <span class="fs-i fs-md-code">parser.py</span> from <span class="fs-i fs-md-code">loop.py</span> and keep the CLI surface unchanged.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>   • keep <span class="fs-i fs-md-code">tokenize()</span> public</span><span>   • add a test for empty input</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="fs-dim">  ↑/↓ · Ctrl-U/D · g/G · Esc/q close</span></div>

## When nothing delegates

Delegation is the model's call, not a command you run — there is no way to force one. If a session
never delegates, check in this order:

1. `/worker` — it reports the configured entry, or `worker: no active session` with the
   `[worker] provider` it would use.
2. `[worker] provider` and `[runtime] worker` in your config, or `/worker on` for this session.
3. **Whether delegation was available when the session started.** If `[worker] provider` was unset
   at startup, the model was never offered the tool, and turning it on now applies to the next
   session. Changing the provider mid-session is fine — that only re-targets a delegation the
   model already has.

Otherwise the model simply saw no task worth handing over, which is the normal case for short work.

## Good to know

- **Reset drops the conversation, not the work.** `/worker reset` clears the worker's context —
  along with any wrong beliefs it picked up — while file changes and merged diffs survive.
- **A failed delegation is not a lost worker.** When a send dies — a provider error, a timeout —
  the worker keeps its context and any files it already changed are merged and named in the
  failure, so the model can answer the problem and send again instead of starting over. Reset it
  when you want the context gone too.
- **Every send asks, even under `yolo`.** The order is a spec the model wrote for itself, so the
  approval brief is the one cheap check on it.
- **The worker inherits your environment.** Same directory, skills, MCP servers, and language
  setting; the files and the repository are what both actually share.
- **Its tokens are its own.** The worker bills to its own entry and keeps its own context, and
  `/status` gives it separate rows — provider and model, context fill with round count, and cache
  ratio — so a delegation never blurs into the parent's numbers.
- **Its sessions are not yours to manage.** Worker snapshots ride along with the parent's and
  never appear in `/sessions`; when the parent's snapshot expires, the worker's goes with it.
